PC Requirements System iCafe is currently built for Windows 10. Windows 7 and earlier versions were not tested. Linux/MacOS may be supported in the future. Hardware High performance GPUs are recommended, as the 3D rendering requires large calculation. At least 8GB memory is needed to perform the 3D filtering of images size of \\(600\\times600\\times200\\) . Remote desktop connection based on OpenGL is not supported, but remote software based on screen capturing, such as Teamviewer and VNC, are not affected. How to acquire or update iCafe Acquisition VIL lab members : The newest version is available under Public/LiChen/iCafe folder. Researchers outside the lab : Please contact Li Chen ( cluw@uw.edu ) for iCafe software with academic research agreement with VIL. Updating Generally, the new version will be compatible with older ones. For updating iCafe, just copy and paste iCafe.exe with replacement if not explicitly noted.

Scroll view In this view three 2D images will be shown. There are three modes for showing different perspectives of the 3D scan. MIP mode In this mode, the 2D images are the Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs) along the superior (S, z-axis), lateral (L), and posterior (P) directions by default. After clicking on the image, a red cross will show the 3D point with the highest intensity along the clicked 2D coordinate. At the same time, the information of the point, such as coordinates and intensity, will appear in Status Bar. If there is a snake within 2 pixels from clicked point, it will be selected and shown in blue. To avoid selecting a snake, hold Alt before click. To zoom in/out, click View -> Zoom in/Zoom out , or press = / - . To switch to the MIP mode from other modes, click View -> MIP -> Show Raw MIP in the menu, or press I . Slice mode When a 3D point is selected, press Space to look the three slices that contain the point from the three directions. To show different slices along the z-axis, drag the slider bar in Slider, or enter a slice number. For other methods to swiching slices, refer to the table below.
